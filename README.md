## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Approach

The project integrates robust machine learning techniques, with a primary focus on the **Random Forest Classifier**. This model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing features such as:

- Atmospheric pressure (hPa)
- Dew point temperature (°C)
- Relative humidity (%)
- Cloud cover (%)
- Sunshine duration (hours)
- Wind direction (degrees)
- Wind speed (km/h)

By analyzing these variables, the model learns complex patterns and relationships that influence rainfall events, enabling it to deliver reliable predictions.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical component of the workflow, involving:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of extra spaces in column names and handling of missing values
- **Feature Engineering**: Dropping highly correlated features (maxtemp, temparature, mintemp)
- **Class Balancing**: Using downsampling techniques to address imbalanced rainfall classes
- **Missing Value Handling**: Mode imputation for categorical variables and median imputation for numerical variables

### Model Optimization

The Random Forest model is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**, ensuring high accuracy and generalizability across diverse weather scenarios. The hyperparameter search includes:

- Number of estimators: [50, 100, 200]
- Maximum features: ["sqrt", "log2"]
- Maximum depth: [None, 10, 20, 30]
- Minimum samples split: [2, 5, 10]
- Minimum samples leaf: [1, 2, 4]
